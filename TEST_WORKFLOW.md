# Workflow Test

This file is created to test the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

Created on: $(date)
Purpose: Verify that the self-hosted runner picks up and executes the workflow correctly.

## Expected Behavior:
1. Runner should detect the push to main branch
2. Execute all steps in the dev-release.yml workflow
3. Deploy the application using PM2
4. Application should be accessible after deployment

## Status:
- [x] Workflow triggered ✅
- [x] Dependencies installed ✅ 
- [x] PM2 deployment completed ✅
- [🔄] Application responding (Testing fixes...)

## � DEPENDENCY ISSUES FIXED:

**Problems Identified & Fixed:**
1. ❌ **Deprecated `crypto` package** still in package.json → ✅ **REMOVED**
2. ❌ **Conflicting `mysql` and `mysql2` packages** → ✅ **Kept mysql2 only**
3. ❌ **MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors** in utils/db.js → ✅ **Dependencies cleaned**

**Applied Fixes:**
- ✅ Removed deprecated `crypto: ^1.0.1` package
- ✅ Removed conflicting `mysql: ^2.18.1` package  
- ✅ Regenerated package-lock.json with clean dependencies
- ✅ Updated workflow to use `npm install` for better dependency resolution
- ✅ Added `npm audit fix --force` to handle security issues
- ✅ Improved deployment verification with detailed logging

**Expected Result:**
- No more MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
- Clean MySQL2 connection without conflicts
- Application should start successfully on port 3000
- 502 Bad Gateway should be resolved
